Description: A dedicated tool for high-throughput grain morphometric analysis and 
    digital seed phenotyping. 'phenokio' provides a streamlined workflow to 
    extract precise physical traits from seed images, including area, perimeter, 
    length, and width. By bridging R and Python's OpenCV via 'reticulate', 
    the package enables robust color-based segmentation with dual HSV thresholds 
    specifically optimized for diverse grain types. It features advanced 
    morphological operations and hole-filling algorithms to handle complex seed 
    surfaces and hilum variations, providing agronomists and researchers with 
    a fast, reproducible method to quantify seed size and shape for crops like 
    soybeans, wheat, and rice.
